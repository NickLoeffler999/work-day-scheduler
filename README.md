# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was designed so that anyone can easily create a schedule for their work day and can track it as well. This webpage is interactive and provides an interface that is easy to navigate for anyone of all ages. It uses fully functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to function. The web application also uses JQuery, Day.Js, and local storage to allow the user to input and save events for the day. The user inputs data into the text area, and when they press the save button, it will be saved in local storage for the next time they go to use the application, or refresh the webpage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The way to use this application is to enter information into the boxes and save them for your future plans. This application can be used by anyone of any age and is very straightforward in how it works. You can access the local storage in Chrome Dev Tools as well with the "Network" tab, which is where all of the information that's stored on your local machine from the Work Day Scheduler will be (aside from on the actual page.)

## Credits

In this project, I used Xander Rapstine's "crispy-octo-meme" repository as my starter code, and built upon it to add more functionality like being able to save the variables you would type into the boxes, improving accessibility, as well as doing a general clean up of the website.
